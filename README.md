# PNG_Decoders

The idea is do some exercises with the PNG specifications and to write a custom
 PNG decoders in different ways:

[x] Python like script

[ ] Python as class

[ ] C

# Organization
In Python folder you can find a first implementation of a PNG decoder where code
is re-organized from Pyokagan's Blog page[1] into two Python scripts.

# How it works
- Python like script:
you run the png_reader script which will read the png into the resources folder and
show it with matplotlib.pyplot lib.

TODO re-write the code as Python class (working in progress).
